# ProgrammingPrinciples

### To run 
So I remember how I've been running. 
- First, ctrl+shift+b to build. 
- Then, in the developer powershell go to ProgrammingPrinciples\x64\Debug and the .exe of the project  you compiled. Each chapter has it's own "project" and then each question will have it's own .cpp file (unless it's a series of drills that build on a single program)
